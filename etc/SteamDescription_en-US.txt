[h1]Kickstart your colony and recover from disasters more easily[/h1]
One single mistake can doom your entire colony and make it seamingly unrecoverable â€“ especially for beginners!

This mod enhances your [b]Printing Pod[/b] and makes surviving the first day cycles significantly easier.

[h1]Oxygen Is Included[/h1]
Your [b]Printing Pod[/b] produces [u]500g/s of oxygen[/u]. This prevents a few duplicates from suffocating and even helps to recover an unbreathable base.

[h1]Potatoe [strike]battery[/strike] generator[/h1]
Your [b]Printing Pod[/b] generates [u]400W[/u] for your power consumption needs. While this cannot power an entire colony, it helps as an emergency/backup power generator if everything else fails.

[h1]Water dispenser[/h1]
Your [b]Printing Pod[/b] produces [u]100g/s of water[/u]. This at least ensures that you can flush the toilet for the day.

[h1]New [i]and even more optimistic[/i] Hope[/h1]
Starting a new game will spawn your headquarters with a functional ventilation and a neat floor lamp. Don't damage this gas piping until you have [b]Ventilation[/b] researched ... unless you want the oxygen generation to stop.

[h1]Change mod settings[/h1]
Open the file [b]%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\mods\Steam\2840201171\settings.yaml[/b] in a text editor and change the settings as your heart desires.

[h1]Concluding remarks[/h1]
I hope this mod helps new players by making the beginning less overwhelming and punishing. More experienced players, who don't want to rush basic colony infrastructure and wish for a more relaxed game start, might enjoy this mod as well.
